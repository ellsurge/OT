_how it basically works_

if you have a large file you can select the
- _filename_ : name of the file

- *batch* : number of columns per split

- *parts* : if you want to create folders to share the splits equally *eg: you have 10 splits and you want to give them to 2 people,* `parts = ['david', 'james']`

- _output_folder_ : creates or selects a folder to output the splits
